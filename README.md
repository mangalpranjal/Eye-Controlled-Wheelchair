# Eye-Controlled-Wheelchair
As the name suggests, this is a wheelchair that can be controlled by the motion of eyes. Being specific though, we built a prototype, which can be easily implemented on an actual wheelchair. We started off with this super-cool project in Novemberâ€™19. The idea sparked as an initiative for a social cause. We were also lucky enough to present our project in the Inter-I.I.T. Tech Meet 8.0 held at IIT Roorkee. 
The idea is to control the movement of the wheelchair with the motion of pupil. The direction in which a person looks is detected by a camera mounted on the wheelchair.  Camera takes frames of eye positions and then processing on the frame done based on the eye position(center, left, right) and returns the result. We also set a Boolean to start or stop the Wheelchair. The person has to close his eyes for 5 seconds for either action. The action is then being send to the NodeMCU by a (int) variable wirelessly. NodeMCU processes the instruction(center, left, right, start, stop) and give power to the wheels according to the instruction.
